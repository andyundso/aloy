# Aloy

Aloy hunts for machines (watching for files) and passes its loot (meta data) to a merchant (webservice).

(Horizon: Zero Dawn is actually a good game).

## Configuration

Aloy expects a configuration file in the project's root (TBC) as a JSON with an array of the paths you want to watch. An example file is present in the project.
